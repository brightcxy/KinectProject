## Introduction

Seldom think about philosophy spontaneously. People donâ€™t really understand their id, ego and superego because of the lack of an appropriate environment to calm down and think. Normally, people rely on the way they look at themselves in the mirrors. However, the mirror only reflects peoples outer appearance, which draws too much attention on the looking. People rarely calm down and think about their inner hearts. The concept of the Zen garden helps people stay there to calm down, and find their inner peace. At the same time of interaction with people, the installation weakens the appearance of people, so as to cause people to think more about their own inner. Screens on the walls are the existing environment that the public spaces have. By creating neat blocks on the screen, the uniform shapes make people calm down. Adding a Kinect sensor to detect people, the wall can interact with people by transforming their outer shape. As a result, it starts meditation and helps people calm down and find their inner peace.
